## Why 4D Fluency?

AI is powerful—but not magic. Teams shipping with AI today face a hard truth: **output quality depends entirely on clarity**. You need to know *what to delegate*, *how to describe it*, *how to verify it works*, and *who's accountable*. That's the **4D Framework**: Delegation, Description, Discernment, Diligence.

**Fluently operationalizes the 4D Framework.** It gives you a CLI, MCP server, and a growing knowledge base of best practices—built on Anthropic's AI Fluency research by Dakan & Feller. Score your team's AI workflows. Learn from the community's Fluently 4D cycles. Ship with confidence.

---

## See It in Action

**Real-world example:** Compare your code review process against community best practices:

```bash
$ fluent compare --task "Automated code review with human sign-off"

Each suggestion links to the full Fluently 4D cycle—delegation guidelines, framing prompts, hallucination patterns to watch for, and approval workflows.

## Install in 30 Seconds

```bash
npm install -g fluently
fluent --help
```

Then score your first task:

```bash
fluent score --description "Automated bug triage with human review" \
             --delegation "augmented" \
             --domain "coding"
```

---

## What's Inside

**CLI** — Run `fluent` in your terminal to score 4D workflows, compare against community patterns, and contribute new Fluently 4D cycles.

**MCP Server** — Embed 4D scoring directly into Claude, VS Code, or any MCP client. Expose tools like `score_delegation()`, `evaluate_discernment()`, and `check_diligence()` to your AI models.

**Knowledge Base** — 50+ community-contributed Fluently 4D cycles organized by domain (coding, writing, research, management, product, etc.). Each cycle is scored on the 4D dimensions and peer-reviewed before merge.

---

## The Knowledge Base Matters

This isn't just a framework—it's a **commons for AI fluency**. Every Fluently 4D cycle you contribute teaches thousands of teams how to collaborate smarter with AI.

Built on the **AI Fluency 4D Framework** by Dakan & Feller / Anthropic, distributed under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**. Code (CLI, MCP, scorer) is MIT. Mix and match.

## Get Started

### For Teams Using AI

1. **Install the CLI** and run `fluent compare --task "your workflow"` to see how others solve similar problems.
2. **Check the Fluently 4D cycles** — find your use case in the knowledge base above.
3. **Score your process** — run `fluent score` with your delegation intent to identify gaps.

### For Teams Building AI Tools

1. **Integrate the MCP server** into your Claude context or IDE plugin.
2. **Expose 4D scoring** to your users — let them verify AI output quality before shipping.
3. **Use the scorer engine** directly — `const { scoreTask } = require('@fluently/scorer')`.

### For Contributors

**Share your Fluently 4D cycles and help the community.** We're looking for patterns, anti-patterns, and real-world lessons from teams shipping AI features.

## How 4D Scoring Works

Every task, workflow, or prompt gets scored across four dimensions:

| Dimension | Question | What We Measure |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Delegation** | *Who decides?* | Clarity on AI autonomy vs. human oversight. Escalation triggers matter. |
| **Description** | *What context?* | Quality of framing + examples + constraints. Reduces ambiguity. |
| **Discernment** | *Is it right?* | Your ability to spot hallucinations and overconfidence. Red flags & green signals. |
| **Diligence** | *Who's accountable?* | Governance, review workflows, audit trails. Who approves before shipping. |

Each scores 0–100. The framework doesn't replace human judgment—it sharpens it.

---

## Roadmap

**Embeddings-based similarity** — Replace keyword matching with semantic search so `find_similar_cycles()` surfaces truly relevant patterns regardless of terminology.

**VS Code extension** — Inline 4D scoring in your editor. @fluently in comments to get suggestions while you write, review, or debug.

**Web playground** — Try 4D scoring live without installing. Experiment with Fluently 4D cycles. Generate your own.

## Tech Stack

```
CLI          → Commander.js + Anthropic SDK
MCP Server   → Model Context Protocol (stdio)
Scorer       → Zod schema validation + keyword matching
Knowledge    → YAML + JSON + GitHub API
Tests        → Vitest
```

**Language**: TypeScript • **Runtime**: Node.js 20+ • **Module**: ESM
